     <p><b><h2>How can I learn to Program?</h2></b></p>
         
     <p> When I talk to people, I see them asking this question a lot. I am nothing special, but also a newbie. However, as every rational being, I have built up own opinions and ideals  that I hold dear to my heart. It hurts me a lot, when I try to exert my opinion and people, irrationally for apparent no reason show their authority and shove my ideals and my opinions down to the pits as if it's nothing but nuisance, to these self proclaimed 'expert' programmers. I believe, every opinion as long as it's not irrational, hold it's own values. Learning of others ideals and opinions helps a lot in not only knowing the person better, but helps in developing your own values and opinions. Using this as my defense, I shall produce my version of how to learn programming.</p>


<p>Programers are the problem solvers. They take a problem, make a solution and then use it to make world a better place. Sounds like a fairy tale? Well everything sounds like a fairy tail. There's nothing new to it. When people ask me, they'd like to learn 'How to Program', I ask them a very simple question: "What problems would you like to solve?" This may sound a bit confusing, so let's just take a look at these well known examples. 
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Web-Developers</li>
		<li>System Programing</li>
		<li>Game-Development</li>
		<li>Embedded Programming</li>
       </ul> 

<p>These may sound very familiar to you. These are the examples of some of the so called problems that you are trying to solve as a Computer Scientis or a programmer. I am a member of a very popular Discord Programming Server called: "The Programmer's Hangout" which has a pretty good advice, that I am going to be giving you guys too: "Pick a language, and learn it." Don't think about what kind of problems you are gonna be solving in the future, if you have not really figured out what you wana do. 'Python or JavaScript' seems to be a great point to start, if youd don't really know what you will be doing.</p>

<p> The advantage of using these languages is the fact that they are general-purpose languages with low difficulty curve. You can do a lot with these languages. Making games, Desktop-Applications, AI, Neural Networks and Websites. This allows you to look into what you can get into, and help you make a decision on what kind of problems you like solving, setting a great carrier path for you. Remember, it's the first language that's the hardest to learn. Once you know the very basics of Programming, no other language is gonna look as hard as it looked to you when you first started. It's gonna be much-much easier, to be honest. In my humble opinion, it's the syntax that's the easy part to learn about a language. It's how to apply this logic rationally, is always the biggest question.  </p>

<p> So what are you waiting for? Hop on to the wonderful world of Programming. Have fun. </p>
